# Employee Polls Project

## Project Description

The **Employee Polls** project is a web application that allows employees to create polls for their coworkers. The core functionality involves asking questions in the form: "Would you rather [option A] or [option B]?". Users cannot choose "neither" or "both" â€” they must decide between the two options.

In this application, users can:

- Answer polls and view both answered and unanswered polls.
- Create new polls for their colleagues to answer.
- See how others have responded to existing polls.
- View a leaderboard that ranks users based on their poll activity.

The application provides features such as logging in, navigating between answered and unanswered polls, voting, posting new polls, and checking user rankings on the leaderboard.

## App Functionality

### Features

- **Login**: Users can impersonate existing users by selecting from a dropdown on the login page. After login, the user can view and interact with polls relevant to their account. Information about the logged-in user is always displayed on the page.
- **Home Page**: After logging in, users are presented with polls categorized into unanswered and answered sections, sorted by creation date (newest at the top). Unanswered polls are displayed by default.
- **Poll Details**: Clicking a poll provides more information, including:
  - "Would You Rather" question text.
  - Avatar of the poll author.
  - Voting options with counts and percentages for answered polls.
- **Voting**: Users can vote on unanswered polls, and upon voting, the poll details are updated to show the results.
  - Users are allowed to vote only once, and they cannot change their answers.
- **404 Page**: If a user attempts to access a poll that does not exist, a 404 error page is displayed.
- **Navigation**: A navigation bar allows easy movement between the home page, leaderboard, and other sections of the application.
- **New Poll**: Users can create new polls by navigating to `/add` and submitting a form with two options. The newly created poll will be displayed in the appropriate category on the home page.
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard at `/leaderboard` shows each user ranked by the number of polls created and answered. Each entry includes the user's name, avatar, number of questions asked, and number of questions answered.
